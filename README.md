# GoSpatial
##Description
GoSpatial is a command-line interface program for analyzing and manipulating geospatial data. It has been developed by [John Lindsay](http://www.uoguelph.ca/geography/faculty/lindsay-john "John Lindsay's homepage") using the [Go](https://golang.org "Go programming language homepage") programming language and is compiled to native code. The project is experimental and is intended to provide additional analytical support for the [Whitebox Geospatial Analysis Tools](http://www.uoguelph.ca/~hydrogeo/Whitebox/ "Whitebox GAT homepage") open-source GIS software. GoSpatial can however run completely independently of any other software. Visit the GoSpatial homepage [here](http://www.uoguelph.ca/~hydrogeo/software.shtml).

##Install
To install the GoSpatial source code using the ```go get``` tool within the terminal, simply type:

```
go get github.com/jblindsay/go-spatial
```

You may then build an executable file using the ```go build``` tool. Pre-compiled versions of the GoSpatial executable will be provided for various supported platforms in the near future and distributed from the [Centre for Hydrogeomatics](http://www.uoguelph.ca/~hydrogeo/software.shtml "Centre for Hydrogeomatics homepage") homepage.

##Usage

Please enter a command:
```

The most common command that you will use is the ```run``` command.

###Working directories
To print the current working directory, use the ```pwd``` command:
```
Please enter a command: pwd
Working directory: /Users/johnlindsay/Documents/Data/
```

To change the working directory, use the ```cwd``` command:
```
Please enter a command: cwd /Users/johnlinsay/Documents/data
```

###Tools
To print a list of available tools, use the ```listtools``` command:
```
Please enter a command: listtools
The following 15 tools are available:
Aspect               Calculates aspect from a DEM
BreachDepressions    Removes depressions in DEMs using selective breaching
D8FlowAccumulation   Performs D8 flow accumulation on a DEM
DeviationFromMean    Calculates the deviation from mean
ElevationPercentile  Calculates the local elevation percentile for a DEM
FD8FlowAccum         Performs FD8 flow accumulation on a DEM
FillDepressions      Removes depressions in DEMs using filling
FillSmallNodataHoles Fills small nodata holes in a raster
Hillshade            Calculates a hillshade raster from a DEM
MaxElevationDeviatio Calculates the maximum elevation deviation across a ran

PrintLASInfo         Prints details of a LAS file
Quantiles            Tranforms raster values into quantiles
Slope                Calculates slope from a DEM
Whitebox2GeoTiff     Converts Whitebox GAT raster to GeoTiff
```

To run a tool from the command-line interface, use the ```run``` command:

```
Please enter a command: run BreachDepressions
*********************
* breachdepressions *
*********************
Enter the DEM file name (incl. file extension):
```

When you run a tool from the command-line interface, you will be guided in terms of the input of the arguments required to run the tool. When you are prompted for an input file name (as in the above example), if the file resides in the current working directory, you can omit the directory from the file name. If you would like to print a list of arguments needed to run a particular plugin tool, with descriptions, use the ```toolargs``` command:

```
Please enter a command: toolargs breachdepressions
The following arguments are listed for 'breachdepressions':
InputDEM               string    The input DEM name with file extension
OutputFile             string    The output filename with file extension
MaxDepth               float64   The maximum breach channel depth (-1 to ignore)
MaxLength              int       The maximum length of a breach channel (-1 to ignore)
ConstrainedBreaching   bool      Use constrained breaching?
SubsequentFilling      bool      Perform post-breach filling?
Please enter a command:
```

This can be helpful when you want to execute a GoSpatial and run a tool by specifying flags and arguments. In the example below, after ```cd```ing to the directory containing the go-spatial executable file, it is possible to run a specific tool (```filldepressions```), providing the arguments for the ```-cwd```, ```-run```, and ```-args``` flags:

```
$ ./go-spatial -cwd="/Users/jlindsay/data/" -run="filldepressions" -args="my DEM.dep;outputDEM.tif;true"
*******************
* filldepressions *
*******************
Reading DEM data...
Filling DEM (2 of 2): 100%
Operation complete!
Elapsed time (excluding file I/O): 5.449522954s
Elapsed time (total): 6.087567077s

```

###Calling GoSpatial Tools From A Script
Sometimes you need to call a GoSpatial tool in an automated fashion, rather than using the GoSpatial command-line interface. Here is an example (*gospatial_example.py* in source folder) of interacting with the GoSpatial library from a Python script:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
import sys
import gospatial as gs

def main():
    try:
        # List all available tools in gospatial
        print(gs.list_tools())

        # Prints the gospatial help...a listing of available commands
        print(gs.help())

        # Print the help documentation for the Aspect tool
        print(gs.tool_help("Aspect"))

        # Prints the arguments used for running the FillDepressions tool
        print(gs.tool_args("FillDepressions"))

        # Run the Aspect tool, specifying the arguments.
        name = "Aspect"
        args = [
            "DEM no OTOs.dep",
            "aspect.dep"
        ]

        # Run the tool and check the return value
        ret = gs.run_tool(name, args, cb)
        if ret != 0:
            print("ERROR: return value={}".format(ret))

    except:
        print("Unexpected error:", sys.exc_info()[0])
        raise

# Create a custom callback to process the text coming out of the tool.
# If a callback is not provided, it will simply print the output stream.
def cb(s):
    if "%" in s:
        str_array = s.split(" ")
        label = s.replace(str_array[len(str_array)-1], "")
        progress = int(str_array[len(str_array)-1].replace("%", "").strip())
        print("\rProgress: {}%".format(progress)),
    else:
        if "error" in s.lower():
            print("\rERROR: {}".format(s)),
        else:
            if not s.startswith("*"):
                print("\r{}          ".format(s)),

main()
```

The code above uses the *gospatial.py* helper script, also found in the source folder.

<!-- ```python
#! /usr/bin/env python3
import subprocess

executablestr = "/Users/me/Projects/go-spatial"
workdir = "/Users/me/Documents/data/"
toolname = "filldepressions"
args = "my DEM.dep;outputDEM.tif;true"

a = [executablestr, "-cwd", workdir, "-run", toolname, "-args", args]

print("Setting up process...")
p = subprocess.Popen(a)
print("Running process...")
p.wait()
print("Done!")
``` -->
